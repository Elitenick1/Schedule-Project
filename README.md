# Schedule-Project
Hello. this is my scheduling project. In this project I pretty much re create my schools schedule. I got student info in a csv. The csv contains students and what classes they will be taking. It is then my job to transfer that information from all the students into a singular schedule that does not overlap. Honestly this was the hardest project I have done. I regret not trying my hardest in the beggining. This project used many data structures things I learned over time. this project was sort of a pre-requisite before attacking my harry potter spell information giver project thing. overall this project was cool but hard
